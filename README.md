Express.js dummy model without database its just to understand the concept of models

// This is just a Dummy model without a database, we would be using a variable to store data instead of a database. 

// The motive is just to clearly understand what a model is and how does it work we later will work with real databases like mysql and mangodb.


we will import models in different controller files and then use them to save new data and also to retrieve data....
